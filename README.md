How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
You write programs tha are maintainable, readable, and adaptable by making sure the code isn't clunky, is readable, and contains no syntax or any other errors. This may take quite some time to get down, but it is essential to being successful as a program. The advantages are being able to provide an efficient code that can handle specific tasks with ease and provide people or computers with a script of what to do in a fast way. 

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
Being organzied and setting out tasks in order of importance are essential to success. I approached this by starting small and ensuring the first step was done right and then going step by step rather than just going to a different piece and doing what I can based on ease. 

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists in my opinion, write programs for computers and people to work more efficiently and faster to help society as a whole.
